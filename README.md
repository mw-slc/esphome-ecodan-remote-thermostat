# ESPHome Ecodan Remote Thermostat

This is Michael's CN-RF coexistence fork. Use the `ecodan_cnrf` component and
platform from this repository alongside HP's separate `ecodan` component.
See [fork integration and compatibility](docs/fork-integration.md) and the
compile-only [dual-UART fixture](tests/dual-uart.yaml). Keep CN-RF hub ID
`ecodan_instance` for the existing room packages; assign HP a different hub ID.
The upstream prebuilt binaries linked below do not include this fork's namespace
isolation. No firmware deployment is implied by the integration tests.
Mimics a remote thermostat over CNRF. You can use any thermostat/temp sensor as a remote thermostat. This projects supports up to 8 remote thermostats. Use any temperature sensor or thermostat as data source for the Ecodan heatpump. The required hardware is the same as used by https://github.com/gekkekoe/esphome-ecodan-hp

# A better alternative
With the introduced Asgard PCB, there's another alternative to CNRF (high resolution supported). [more info](https://github.com/gekkekoe/esphome-ecodan-hp/discussions/261)

# Installation
Power down your unit (use circuit breaker!) and plug the flashed unit into the CNRF port. It's near the regular CN105 port. 

- Turn `SW1-8` to on to enable the remote thermostat. Restore the power and select the remote thermostat as thermostat. If you are using `IN1` port, you probably need to disable it via `SW2-1`. 
- Map the wireless thermostat to a room via: `initial settings` > `room sensor settings` > `zone 1 and/or 2` > `sensor settings` > select the configured RCx here.
- Assign RC to a zone via: `initial settings` > `room sensor settings` > `Room RC zone select` > Set your RCx to the correct zone

Use the REST API or Home assistant to supply room temperatures.
